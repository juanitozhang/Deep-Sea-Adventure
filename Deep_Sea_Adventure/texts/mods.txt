THE MODIFICATIONS THAT WERE DONE ARE:

1. To determine the first player in the game,
   we leave to the players to decide.

2. In sunken ruin chips, the players cannot
   decide where to stack them, it is done rand
   omly. Also, each round starts the stacking
   all over again, so that if there was 
   a stack of 2 in the last round, it will not 
   be completed into a stack of 3. 
   
3. If two players get the same points it simply
   ends in a draw.
